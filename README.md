# Nivaaran

## Problem Statement
India has too few doctors, and doctors spend a large part of each consultation collecting basic patient information.  
This reduces time for diagnosis and care, especially in high-volume clinics and OPDs.

---

## Users & Context

**Primary Users**
- Doctors  
- Clinic and hospital staff  

**Secondary Users**
- Patients (first-time and repeat visitors)

**Context**
- Busy OPDs, clinics, and hospitals where doctors see many patients every day

## Solution Overview

Nivaaran is a **pre-consultation assistant** that collects patient symptoms and past prescriptions before the doctor visit and generates a **doctor-ready summary**.

**Workflow**
Patient enters details & uploads prescription
↓
Nivaaran extracts key medical information
↓
Doctor reviews a clean summary before consultation

## Models & Data

AI Approach :
- Deterministic, rule-based clinical information extraction (MVP)

Data Sources :
- Patient-entered form data
- OCR-extracted text from uploaded medical documents

Licensing :
- Only user-provided data is used
- No third-party medical datasets involved

---

## Evaluation & Guardrails
- No diagnosis or treatment recommendations
- No hallucination: only extracts information present in inputs
- Clear labeling: “AI-Assisted – Rule-Based MVP”
- Original uploaded documents are always available for doctor verification

---

## Known Limitations & Risks
- Rule-based extraction may miss uncommon medicine formats
- Handwritten prescriptions can reduce OCR accuracy
- Not a medical decision system (summary assistance only)
